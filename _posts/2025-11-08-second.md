Here's a quick guide on how I set up this website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is perfect for simple, static websites because:

1. It's built into GitHub Pages (no extra setup)
2. You write in Markdown (easy and portable)
3. It's fast and secure (static HTML)
4. Version control with Git is built-in

## The Setup Process

The setup was surprisingly simple:

1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`
2. Add a `_config.yml` file
3. Create some Markdown files for pages
4. Add blog posts to the `_posts/` folder
5. Push to GitHub

That's it! GitHub automatically builds and deploys your site.

## Next Steps

Now I can focus on:
- Writing content
- Customizing the theme later
- Adding more features as needed

The skeleton is done, and prettifying can wait!
