Welcome to my personal blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts, projects, and learnings here.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- AI and machine learning projects
- Technical tutorials and tips
- Personal reflections on my work
- Updates on what I'm learning

## Getting Started

This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a simple setup that lets me focus on writing content without worrying too much about the infrastructure.

Stay tuned for more posts!
